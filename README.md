# Sentiment-Analysis
This repo has all the code and datasets require to learn and understand how sentiment analysis is done. This repo also has the GUI as the application of sentiment analysis.

This repo the python code for building a model using Naive Bayes classifier, Logistic Regression and many. Anyone can use it to learn and understand how the sentiment analysis is done.

The kpt_gui.zip has an application to Sentiment Analysis, where a user can enter some sentiments (supports English only) and can analyze what sentiment is. This seems trivial task but this GUI comes in handy when a user wants to analyze a chunk of data quickly. The README for this gui can be found inside the kpt_gui.zip, which has step by step process to use the GUI.

NOTE: 
The GUI is basic one but complex enough to get the hold of how Sentiment Analysis is done, also there is always a room for improvement. For better performance of the GUI, just search for the big enough dataset of size in GBs may be and you will how the performance gets affected (for good).
